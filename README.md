# MATLAB Onramp Foundations

This repository documents my structured journey through the **MATLAB® Onramp**
course and my transition into deeper numerical computing, Simulink modelling,
and embedded AI.

The goal is to:
- Build strong MATLAB fundamentals
- Develop an engineering mindset around vectors, matrices, plotting, and data
- Prepare for Cleve Moler’s *Numerical Computing with MATLAB* and model-based,
  embedded workflows (Simulink + code generation)
